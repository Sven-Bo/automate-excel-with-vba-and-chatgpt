# ChatGPT: Automating Excel with VBA like never before ðŸ¤¯
In this video I'm going to show you how I use VBA and ChatGPT to automate some pretty tedious Excel tasks. We'll be consolidating data, sending mass emails with personalized text and attachments, and even automating pivot table creation. I'll walk you through step by step, showing you how easy it is to use ChatGPT to generate the VBA code for these tasks, and how little effort it takes to implement them in your own workbooks. So, come along with me and let's make Excel work for us, instead of the other way around!
